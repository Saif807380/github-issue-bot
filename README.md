# Issue-Label-Bot-ML-Project

- Contributors on GitHub can open issues in repositories highlighting some problem with the codebase or the documentation.
- Issues can be classified using labels such as ‘bug’, ‘feature’, ‘documentation’, etc. Such classification makes it easy for the maintainers to triage issues, for example, by giving priority to resolving a ‘bug’ over ‘documentation’.
- Presently, most issues have to be labelled manually, which is a laborious task. An issue labelling bot would automatically label issues when they are created, making it easier to handle issue creation and prioritization.
